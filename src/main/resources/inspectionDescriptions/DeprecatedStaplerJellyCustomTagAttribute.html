Reports usages of deprecated tag attributes in Jelly files.
<p>
    It only analyzes custom tag libraries (a package of Jelly files with a marker file <code>taglib</code>). For attribute to be recognized and considered deprecated it must be explicitly documented and marked as deprecated. Use "Navigate to definition" to jump to the documentation to find the resolution.
